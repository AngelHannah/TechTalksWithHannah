    <h1>A Little About Me</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Hannah and I am currently in my fourth quarter working my way to an AAS degree in Computer Science from Renton Technical College. Outside of my college life I am first and foremost a stay-at-home mother to a beautiful 2 and a half year old little girl. I am also a furmother to a wonderful 100 pound Labrakita named Isaac. I also have a wonderful husband and we will celebrate our 3rd wedding anniversary in June of 2022. If you'd like to see some pictures of my wonderful little family then you can head on over to my <a href = "photogallery.html">photo gallery</a> to see some pictures of my little village.  </p>
