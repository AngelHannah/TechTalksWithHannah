         <div id = "blog-post"> Over the last couple of months I have been contemplating the idea of being a TA and/or tutor at my school since the idea was proposed to me by a good friend and a classmate of mine. About a week ago I finally decided to take the leap and I submitted my less than glorious resume. To my delight my resume was quickly accepted, and I first heard back the same day and then was schedule for an interview the following day. As with any interview I had the worst anxiety but like usual I managed to keep my composure. On a side note I will say that if I ever make it to a position where I have to interview people, I would like to strive to make the interviewing process as comfortable as possible. There is no reason an interview should strike fear into someone. Thankfully most of my anxiety turned out to be all for naught because the interview went very well, my interviewer and I even shared a few laughs which helped to make things more comfortable.
