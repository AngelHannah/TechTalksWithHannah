         <div id = "blog-post"> For many people Valentine's Day is a wonderful day full of love and care. For others it's a heartbreaking reminder that they are going through their life without a partner by their side once again. I've experienced both sides of this holiday and quite a few in between as well. This year it wasn't much of a holiday being celebrated, it was more of a normal monday and an extremely busy one might I add. My day started early in the morning, far earlier than my day usually starts. It started with waking up to a phone call then followed by a two hour long drive to pick up my new roommates. I made it back to my house in time to attend my Database class, where we reviewed the midterm because so many people in the class struggled with it, myself included. Then immediately following my class I had to go to my school campus to drop off some documents to complete my new hire paperwork, of course it was monday so this wasn't going to happen smoothly. When I arrived to the HR department, the lights were on but the door was locked and no matter how much I seemed to knock on the glass, I never got a response. I called the HR person I'd previously been in contact with, received no answer and left a voicemail hopeful that I would quickly receive a call back. That proved to not be the case unfortunately, I didn't receive a call until much later in the day asking me why I hadn't shown up. I immediately went through the long explanation of my failed adventure and was thankfully able to provide necessary information over the phone so I could be put in the system in time! It's been a long week already and it's only half an hour into Tuesday, I'm sure the rest of the week will also be interesting.
