         <div id = "blog-post"> My last post may have been slightly over ambitious because come to find out, I was not in fact ready to "rock and roll" apparently. Life got in the way so now I am up late adding posts to my blog to fullfil the needs of my Web Dev midterm. I still have some exciting plans in store for my blog and also for my portfolio that has been sorely neglected unfortunately. Last week was midterm week, and of course with that comes the stress of exams. Thankfully in the Computer Science world, our exams are more doing than writing which makes me happy. Much to my dismay I must report that I did fail my Database midterm. I know, I know, you're thinking some thing like "Wow, how could you let that happen?!". There were several factors that affected it but the biggest one was that I did not properly understand all the tools that I needed to use in order to answer the questions properly. After several hours of mild to moderate panic I sent my Database teacher a message and then worried about it all weekend (these things always seem to happen on a friday don't they). Monday has finally rolled around and I had a chance to talk to my teacher about my poor grade. She was unable to allow me a resubmission but she did agree to create a new test that I could take for extra credit which I am very thankful for.
