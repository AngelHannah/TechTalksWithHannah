         <div id = "blog-post"> As you can see by the dates of these two posts, I have most certainly fallen behind on updating my blog. No need to worry however because I am back and ready to rock. I've done a little updating today. I added a lovely navigation bar at the top of the screen so my visitors are able to quickly click to their desired destination. I must thank the wonderous and talented Will Cram for providing me with the code for the navigation bar(whether he intended it that way or not :) ). I happily took it and have made it my own. I'm enjoying the purple look of the site so far but there are many wonderous changes to come in the near future as I progress through my Web Dev class. This weekend I will be implementing several things such as Div and Span to enable me to more easily choose what I want to style with the stylesheet. Im excited to see what comes next!
