                    <p><em>1 - 8 - 2022</em></p>

                        Hello and welcome to tech talks with me, Hannah. I enjoy many tech related topics and that is what we will be discussing here on this blog. This week I'll start off with talking about Unity which is a 
                        wonderful game engine used to design many games such as Escape From Tarkov, Cities Skylines, and Rust. Unity is also used to create incredible animated short films. To read the rest of this blog post you can <a  class = "post-link" href="BlogPost1.html">click here</a>.

                                As you can see by the dates of these two posts, I have most certainly fallen behind on updating my blog. No need to worry however because I am back and ready to rock. I've done a little updating today. <a  class = "post-link" href="BlogPost2.html">Click here</a> to read about it.

                            My last post may have been slightly over ambitious because come to find out, I was not in fact ready to "rock and roll" apparently. Life got in the way so now I am up late adding posts to my blog to fullfil the needs of my Web Dev midterm. Want to hear more about my midterm week? <a  class = "post-link" href="BlogPost2.html">Click here</a> to do just that!
