        <h2>Post No. 1: Unity Game Development</h2>
        <p>1 - 8 - 2022</p>
        <p>
         Hello and welcome to tech talks with me, Hannah. I enjoy many tech related topics and that is what we will be discussing here on this blog. This week I'll start off with talking about Unity which is a 
         wonderful game engine used to design many games such as Escape From Tarkov, Cities Skylines, and Rust. Unity is also used to create incredible animated short films. This past summer I was lucky enough 
         to meet a great friend who taught me the basics of Unity. I am definitely still a humble beginner in the big world of game development but learning to use Unity has been an exciting experience for me so far
         which I plan to continue with in the immediate future. So far I have started with my first project building a small kart racing game. My next interest will be in creating a small interactive learning game 
         for my daughter because I think it would be wonderful to be able to use my talents to create a personalized game for my child.

        <h2>Post No. 2: Webpage Endeavors</h2>
        <p><em>1 - 26 - 2022</em></p>
        <p>
            As you can see byu the dates of these two posts, I have most certainly fallen behind on updating my blog. No need to worry however because I am back and ready to rock. I've done a little updating today. I added a lovely navigation bar at the top of the screen so my visitors are able to quickly click to their desired destination. I must thank the wonderous and talented Will Cram for providing me with the code for the navigation bar(whether he intended it that way or not :) ). I happily took it and have made it my own. I'm enjoying the purple look of the site so far but there are many wonderous changes to come in the near future as I progress through my Web Dev class. This weekend I will be implementing several things such as Div and Span to liven up the page just a bit more. Im excited to see what comes next!
