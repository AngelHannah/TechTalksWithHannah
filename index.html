         Hello and welcome to tech talks with me, Hannah. I enjoy many tech related topics and that is what we will be discussing here on this blog. This week I'll start off with talking about Unity which is a 
         wonderful game engine used to design many games such as Escape From Tarkov, Cities Skylines, and Rust. Unity is also used to create incredible animated short films. This past summer I was lucky enough 
         to meet a great friend who taught me the basics of Unity. I am definitely still a humble beginner in the big world of game development but learning to use Unity has been an exciting experience for me so far
         which I plan to continue with in the immediate future. So far I have started with my first project building a small kart racing game. My next interest will be in creating a small interactive learning game 
         for my daughter because I think it would be wonderful to be able to use my talents to create a personalized game for my child.
